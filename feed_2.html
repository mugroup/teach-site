					<description><![CDATA[These strategies are so important for young children, teenagers and young adults with dyslexia to hear. I am an ECE teacher and also studying post graduate literacy education.  My son (17) is dyslexic he agrees it is a gift he is  exceptional when it comes to Calculus, he just says to me &quot;don&#039;t give me the basic maths&quot; and his SPELD tutor considers his memory is surprisingly outstanding he picks up and remembers the little details in pictures. My sister believes her young grandson(8) is dyslexic he already has many of the &#039;negative Mathew effects&#039; of this. She tells me he is such a bright kid and has such great ideas however he does not not want to read, or go to school, and compares himself to his peers, saying he is dumb, and could never read like them.  I will be passing this along to her for reading.
Thankyou.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello

I agree with your diagnosis. The test you describe strongly suggests your daughter has a specific reading disability or dyslexia. I would be interested in her strengths in and out of school. Your daughter may be &quot;right-brain dominant&quot; and tries to read with the right side of the brain. Reading is left-brained. 
School is often brutal for these smart kids. Self-esteem is often negatively impacted as early as grade 2. Things get worse after grade 3 when the curriculum changes from &quot;learning to read&quot; to &quot;reading to learn&quot;.
ADD is often a mistaken diagnosis. Timed-tests are brutal because dyslexics require more processing time for language-based exercises. Are you able to get 504 accommodations to allow her more time?

There is good news. Your daughter can become a fluent reader. Our software wires the reading centres in the rear left side of the brain. The lessons develop fluent decoding skills. When decoding becomes automatic, comprehension improves dramatically. Our Orton-Gillingham based software we use has recently been endorsed by the Council of Administrators of Special Education (C.A.S.E.). Our students achieve significant and permanent gains through the patented, research-based instructional model that builds strong roots in the five areas outlined by the National Reading Panel: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The lessons are exactly what Yale&#039;s Dr Sally Shaywitz recommends in her book Overcoming Dyslexia.

Staff at OnlineReadingTutor<img src="2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> have used this software  since 1993 and have helped over three hundred students improve their reading comprehension and fluency. All of these students had an IEP for their learning disability. Many of these were independently diagnosed with dyslexia. 

Your daughter will have a minimum of will have 58 lessons to master as well as oral reading fluency exercises. At the end of this training she will be at or above grade level. We expect students to train four to five times a week for 30 minutes at a time. Students train at a time that is most convenient for them. We use Skype, FaceTime, phone calls and email to connect with students and parents. We are available six days a week, 8 am to 9 pm.

We guarantee at least a full grade level improvement after thirty hours of on-task training. Currently we are tutoring students in Canada, United States and Australia and Russia. We have helped several students from California.
To see if we are a good fit you may request a free trial &lt;a href=&quot;https://compasssoftwareltd.com/free-assessment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel my fourth grade daughter has dyslexia. She has been struggling in school since first grade. She was tested in the public school system and was average to high in all areas except new word recognition and pronunciation.She does horrible on timed tests,is not a great speller and struggles with reading fluency. Her third grade teacher said she &quot;daydreams&quot; , &quot;spaces out&quot; and could  possibly even be ADD. I disagreed. But this mindset in education has my child&#039;s confidence challenged and grades lowered because dyslexia is not recognized in CA public schools unless you have a medical excuse. It is very costly to be tested and my family is looking for ways or help. Any suggestions are appreciated.]]></description>
